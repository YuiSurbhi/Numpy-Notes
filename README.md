# Numpy-Notes

## 👉 About Numpy:

🧮 **NumPy:** NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides powerful array objects, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.<br>

▫️ Numpy stands for **(Numerical Python)**.<br>

▫️ Numpy is a Python liberty which is commonly used in Numerical Computing.<br>

▫️ This Python liberty is used for working arrays.<br>

▫️ Numpy provides powerful N-Dimensional array object (ndarray), as well as supportive functions or tools 
   used in these arrays.<br>

▫️ It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, matrices, etc. <br>

## 🔸 Why Use NumPy? :

▫️ **Speed:** Optimized for performance, making it faster than standard Python lists.<br>

▫️ **Functionality:** Provides a wide range of mathematical functions.<br>

## 🔸 History :

▫️ Numpy was created by Travis Oliphant in 2005, while he was a graduate student at Mayo Clinic.<br>

## Installation ⚙️

▪️ If <ins>Python</ins> and <ins>PIP</ins> are already installed on your system, then installing Numpy is easy.<br>

▪️ Install it using this command:<br>

      pip install numpy

##  🔸 How can we use Numpy :

▪️ Once Numpy is installed, import it into your applications by adding the <code>import</code> keyword.<br>
▪️ Numpy is imported under <code>np</code> alias.<br>
▪️ This alias is created with the help of <code>as</code> keyword while importing.<br>

      import numpy as np

▪️ After this, Numpy can be referred as <code>np</code> instead of <code>numpy</code>.<br>
▪️ Now, Numpy is imported and ready to use.<br>

### Example 

     import numpy as np
 
     arr=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
     print(arr)

**Output**

    [1 2 3 4 5]
