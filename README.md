# Numpy-Notes

## 👉 About Numpy:

🧮 **NumPy:** NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides powerful array objects, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.<br>

▫️ Numpy stands for **(Numerical Python)**.<br>

▫️ Numpy is a Python liberty which is commonly used in Numerical Computing.<br>

▫️ This Python liberty is used for working arrays.<br>

▫️ Numpy provide powerful N-Dimensional array object (ndarray), as well as supportive functions or tools 
   used in these arrays.<br>

▫️ It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, matrices etc. <br>

### 🔸 Why Use NumPy? :

▫️ **Speed:** Optimized for performance, making it faster than standard Python lists.<br>

▫️ **Functionality:** Provides a wide range of mathematical functions.<br>

### 🔹 History :

▫️ Numpy was created by Travis Oliphant in 2005, while he was a graduate student at Mayo Clinic.<br>

###  🔸 How can we use Numpy :

▫️ import numpy as np<br>
